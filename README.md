# Project Euler's Solutions by lesxavier

Here you can find some of my coding solutions to Project Euler's (https://projecteuler.net/) purposed problems. At first I'll try to get rid of them using Python, but sometimes I'll use some C, R or Java just to practice. When it fits, I'll be adding some mathematical explanation to these problems/solutions.

Project Euler is a website with a set of mathmatics (by now it has 629 problems) projected to be solved with some programming. To learn more about it, I recommend you to visit https://projecteuler.net/about/ and have some fun by yourself. I also recommend you to use my explanations as your guidelines if you will, but not to just copy them, once all the fun is about to solve PE's problems with all you learned.

End.
